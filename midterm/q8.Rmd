This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(rpart)
library(openxlsx)

# Assuming your data is in a data frame called 'data'
data <- read.csv("UCI_heart_V3.csv")

# Fit a CART model
cart_model <- rpart(Heart_problem ~ ., data = data, method = "class")

# Extract the first split
first_split <- cart_model$splits[1,]

# Create a data frame for the split information
split_df <- data.frame(
  Feature = rownames(first_split),
  SplitValue = first_split[1, "index"],
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Write to Excel file
write.xlsx(split_df, "first_split.xlsx")

print("Excel file 'first_split.xlsx' has been created with the first level split.")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
